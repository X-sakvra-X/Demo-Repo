<h2>~ Chapter I ~</h2>
<p>As he settled into the nest, he carefully dropped the fresh-kill in front of three feathery puffs nestled together. “Eat,” he said gently, nudging the food closer with his beak. 
<br>
        The little juveniles tilted their heads, their eyes wide with curiosity. “Is this a rabbit?” one of them chirped, poking at the meal with a hesitant claw. 
<br>
        “Yes,” he replied with a small nod, his tone softening. “Mother will be here shortly to feed you too.” He pushed the food closer, his movements deliberate, ensuring they could easily reach it. “Don’t give her any trouble, yeah?” His voice carried a mix of sternness and warmth, his gaze flicking over each of their tiny forms. 
<br>
        They nodded eagerly, their feathers fluffing up in unison, and he couldn’t help the faint smile that tugged at the edges of his beak. Satisfied, he turned and stepped out of the nest, the soft sound of their excited chirps trailing after him as he made his way back to his duties. 
<br>
 <br>
 <br>
        “Enzo! Come here! We’re sharing tongues!” one of his flock-mates called, breaking his focus from his conversation with his mother. 
<br>
        “I’m coming, you twits,” he grumbled, ruffling his navy-blue feathers in irritation. With a reluctant stretch of his wings, he made his way over. 
<br>
        “What do you idiots want now?” he huffed as he settled beside them, tucking his feet neatly beneath him. 
<br>
<br>
        The group exchanged glances before one of them spoke, a serious tone cutting through their usual banter. “We might migrate south. This godforsaken place has become practically uninhabitable ever since the Up-walkers started treating us like buzz-kill.” 
<br>
        Enzo’s beak twitched, a flicker of irritation crossing his face. “Migrate south?” he repeated, his voice low. “And leave everything behind? The nests, the young, all of it?” 
 <br>
        One of his flock-mates shrugged, their feathers rustling softly. “What choice do we have? The air is thicker with every passing day, and food’s becoming harder to find. It’s either move or risk losing more than we already have.” 
 <br>
        Enzo paused mid-preen, his beak still nestled among his feathers. Slowly, he lifted his head, his piercing gaze locking onto the group. His eyes bored into their skulls, sharp and unyielding. “What?” he asked, his voice low and measured, though the edge of his tone hinted at a storm brewing beneath. 
<br>
        Kannan, the one who had broken the news, flinched under the weight of Enzo’s stare. His feathers puffed up involuntarily as he flapped his wings in a hurried, nervous gesture. “I-I mean... we’re not leaving right away!” he stammered, his voice cracking slightly. “It’s just—uh—we’re thinking ahead. When leaf-fall comes around, we’d prepare to migrate before leaf-bare sets in... you know, to keep everyone safe.”</p>
        The words tumbled out in a rush; Kannan’s unease as clear as the frantic flick of his tail feathers. 
<br>
        Enzo’s gaze didn’t waver, his expression unreadable as the silence stretched between them. Finally, he clicked his beak softly, a sound more ominous than reassuring. 
<br>
<br>
        The group shifted uncomfortably, exchanging nervous glances but saying nothing more. Enzo, with a last lingering look, returned to preening, though the tension in his shoulders betrayed the turmoil stirring beneath his calm exterior. 
<br>
        “The flock’s moving to the Yellow-foot Flock near the Great Waterfall,” Kannan explained, his tone careful, as though treading on thin ice.
<br>
        “No—” Enzo began, but his objection was cut short.
<br>
        “Yes, you will go. You have no choice, Enzo,” came the gravelly voice of Old Ohm, the elder heron, as he lumbered toward the group. His weathered feathers glinted faintly in the dim light, and his steps carried the weight of authority. “A terrible fate will befall us all if we stay here any longer.”
<br>
        “Oh, come on! All this panic over a little snow?” Enzo snapped, his navy-blue feathers bristling. “We’ve survived leaf-bare before! What’s so different about this one?”
<br>
        “This is a leaf-bare unlike any other, Enzo,” Old Ohm countered, his voice rising with a sharp edge, his eyes narrowing. “You need to take this seriously.”
<br>
        Enzo scoffed, his frustration bubbling over. “I need to take this seriously? I’m the most serious heron in this flock! You’re the ones running scared over something we’ve weathered countless times before. This is ridiculous!”
<br>
        The tension hung thick in the air as Enzo’s words echoed off the cavern walls. Kannan shifted uncomfortably, his wings twitching, while Old Ohm stood firm, his gaze steady and unyielding.
<br>
        “This is no ordinary storm, Enzo,” the elder said quietly, his tone heavy with foreboding. “You may not see it yet, but you will. And when you do, I hope it’s not too late to save yourself—or this flock.”
<br>
<br>
        “Okay, okay, fine. We’re going to the Yellow-foot Flock. In how many moons?” Enzo grumbled, his wings puffing out in annoyance.
<br>
        “Greenleaf is ending soon
<br>
<br>
        ‘It’s going to be a long thirteen moons with those stuck-ups,’ he thought, his feathers ruffling slightly in irritation. The mere idea of enduring their haughty attitudes made his beak twitch.
